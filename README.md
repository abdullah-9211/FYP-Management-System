# FYP-Management-System
Web Application to manage all the processes involved in FYP Evaluation in one place

## Description

- Web Application implemented using ASP.NET Web Forms and MS SQL Server for Database.
- We have 4 types of users; Admin, Supervisor, Panel and FYP Group Member.
- Admin can add users and basically make sure the system is working in a flow.
- Supervisors are responsible for viewing the work of their FYP Group and communicate with the members.
- Panel Members are responsible for evaluating the FYP and Supervisors. They can leave a review on the supervisor.
- Group Members can view tasks, notifications and communicate with supervisor.

All users have their own dashboards with their own actions listed there according to the type of user. User managements and permissions are managed through database where username and passwords of each user are stored.
A log is also maintained which keeps track of the activity done by a user at that specific time and date like "Abdullah Umar logged in at 10:45 11/12/2023".
